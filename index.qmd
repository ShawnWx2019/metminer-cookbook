### Project

**MetMiner:** An Integrated Pipeline for Large-Scale Metabolomics Data Processing and Data Mining.

This is the documentation of **MetMiner**. You can get up-to-date verison from the GitHub repository <https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/MetMiner>.

In this workflow, [tidyMass](https://www.tidymass.org/) @shenTidyMassObjectorientedReproducible2022b and [HPC-tidymass](https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/HPC_tidymass) takes on the majority of the upstream data analysis, data cleaning, and metabolite annotation tasks.

Furthermore, we have developed a Metabolomics Downstream Analysis toolkit [MDAtoolkits](https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/MDAtoolkits/tree/master) and a user-friendly [WGCNA Shiny app](https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/WGCNA-shinyApp). They are responsible for the downstream analysis and data mining section.
